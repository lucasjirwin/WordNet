# WordNet

 ShortestCommonAncestor.java creates a Shortest Common Ancestor object from a directed acyclic graph. Supports calculating the distance between two vertices or two subsets of vertices by implementing breadth first search and using two Linear Probing HashTables. Additionally supports finding the shortest common ancestor of two vertices or two subsets of vertices. 
 
 WordNet.java creates a WordNet Digraph by reading in a file of synsets and a file of hypernyms and storing the synsets in two symbol tables, and the hypernyms in a digraph. Supports iteration over all Wordnet nouns, checking if a noun is in the Wordnet, finding the distance between two nouns and finding the shortest common ancestor of two nouns.
